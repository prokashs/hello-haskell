Short answer: **yes, but not as the dominant languages**.

Haskell and ML-family languages *are used in AI*, but mostly in **research, foundations, and specialized systems**, not in mainstream production AI like PyTorch/TensorFlow pipelines.

Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## 1️⃣ What languages dominate AI in practice?

### **Production & mainstream AI**

* **Python** → *by far #1*

  * PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Hugging Face
* **C++ / CUDA**

  * performance-critical kernels
* **Rust / Go**

  * infrastructure, serving, safety tooling (growing fast)

These dominate because of **ecosystem + hardware support**, not because they’re ideal languages.

---

## 2️⃣ Where Haskell *is* used in AI

Haskell appears mainly in:

### 🧠 **Research & theory-heavy AI**

* probabilistic programming
* symbolic AI
* program synthesis
* formal verification of models
* differentiable programming research

Examples:

* **Probabilistic programming** (e.g. monads, compositional models)
* **Automatic differentiation** (clean functional formulations)
* **DSLs for ML** embedded in Haskell

Why Haskell fits:

* strong static typing
* purity → easy reasoning
* higher-order abstractions
* equational reasoning

But…

❌ Limited GPU ecosystem
❌ Fewer ready-to-use ML libraries
❌ Harder onboarding for teams

So it stays **niche but influential**.

## 3️⃣ ML-family languages (OCaml, Standard ML, F#)

### Where they show up:

#### 🔬 **Research labs & compilers**

* model checking
* symbolic reasoning
* theorem provers
* language-based AI tools

#### 🧪 **Notable examples**

* **OCaml**

  * used at Jane Street (quant + ML infra)
  * Facebook (Flow, Infer – not AI models, but AI-adjacent tooling)
* **F#**

  * ML.NET
  * data science on .NET
* **Standard ML**

  * mostly academic, language research

ML languages influenced AI *far more than they are used directly*.

## 4️⃣ The *hidden influence*: ML languages shaped modern AI

This is the important part.

Many AI ideas **come from functional & ML languages**:

| AI concept                | Origin                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Automatic differentiation | functional programming   |
| Computation graphs        | functional ASTs          |
| JAX-style transformations | ML / Haskell ideas       |
| Type-safe tensor DSLs     | ML-style type systems    |
| Effect systems            | Haskell / OCaml research |

Example:

* **JAX** is basically *Haskell ideas implemented in Python*
* PyTorch’s autograd mirrors **functional differentiation**

So even if AI *runs in Python*, the **thinking is functional**.

---

## 5️⃣ Why Python still wins

Despite weaknesses, Python wins because:

* massive GPU + vendor support
* fastest research iteration
* huge pretrained model ecosystem
* easy onboarding

AI research values **speed of experimentation** over language purity.

---

## 6️⃣ Where Haskell / ML may grow in AI

They’re gaining traction in:

* **AI safety & verification**
* **correctness of ML systems**
* **compiler-based ML** (XLA, MLIR-style systems)
* **symbolic + neural hybrid AI**
* **DSLs for training / inference**

Rust is currently benefiting the most from these ideas in production.

---

## 🔑 Bottom line

* **Yes**, Haskell and ML languages are used in AI
* **No**, they are not mainstream for training large models
* **Yes**, they heavily influence how AI systems are designed
* **Yes**, they shine in correctness, theory, and tooling

If you’re coming from **Haskell / systems background** (which you clearly are), you’re actually *well-positioned* for:

* AI infrastructure
* ML compilers
* safety-critical AI
* research roles

If you want, I can map:

* **Haskell → AI paths**
* **ML concepts → PyTorch/JAX equivalents**
* **Which AI areas reward strong type theory**

Just say the word.
